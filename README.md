# AI Code Templates

A repository of templates and standards for building systems with AI assistance.

## What's Included

### Development Approach
- **`development-approach/v1/`** - Iterative specification-first development methodology optimized for AI-assisted development
- Covers hypothesis-driven development, focused feature decomposition, and AI-optimized context management
- Includes templates for feature specifications, development history, and documentation patterns

### Technical Standards  
- **`standards/firebase-react-typescript/v1/`** - Comprehensive technical standards for Firebase + React + TypeScript projects
- Technology stack definitions, code quality standards, file organization conventions
- Testing strategies, monorepo patterns, and development workflow guidelines

## Purpose

This repository provides:

1. **Development Methodology** - A proven approach for rapid, AI-assisted feature development with clear separation between system capabilities and development history

2. **Technical Standards** - Battle-tested conventions for modern web applications using Firebase, React, and TypeScript

3. **Templates and Patterns** - Reusable structures for specifications, documentation, and project organization

## Usage

These templates are designed to be copied and adapted for new projects. Each version (v1) represents a stable set of practices that can be evolved independently.
